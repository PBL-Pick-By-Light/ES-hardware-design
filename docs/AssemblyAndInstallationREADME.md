# Assembly

Before you begin replicating our implementation of the PBL make sure you have all necessary parts and that they are fitting to your spare parts container. You can find a listing of all parts [here](../docs/PartsListingREADME.md) and the specifications of the spare parts container [here](../docs/TechnicalSpecsREADME.md).

Further information can be found in the [users guide](../Documentation/PBL%20Users%20Guide.pdf).

## Assembly and attachment of acrylsheets

Make sure your acrylic glass sheets are thin enough so each compartment can still be drawn outwards.

## Installing the holding mechanisms

When everything is installed it should look something like this:
